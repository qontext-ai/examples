# Qontext AI Examples

Demos and sample projects that use the [Qontext AI](https://qontext.ai) API for retrieval and knowledge grounding. Use them as reference for agents or plugging Qontext into any LLM or workflow.

## What's in this repo

- **gemini-agent** — Agent that answers prompts based on context saved in a Qontext vault. This makes the vault directly chattable. Answers are generated with Vertex AI Gemini (Google ADK). Requires `QONTEXT_API_KEY` and `QONTEXT_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ID`; From the repo root: `cd gemini-agent && pip install -r requirements.txt`, then see the folder for our Gemini Docs.
